## Creating a face recognition algorithm
I used FaceNets (supervised learning) and Eigenfaces (unsupervised learning) to create face recognition algorithms using my classmates as a dataset. Results of the code can be seen in the Jupyter notebooks themselves. A detailed research paper on the face recognition algorithms I used can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1598xceIfkDeDQmPRQhCrsC8KbZ0vLFTGVJUl3PAp99o/edit?usp=sharing)
